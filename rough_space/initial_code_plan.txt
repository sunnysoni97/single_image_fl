So the plan goes as :
(first starting with the client side)


1. setting up the preprocessor to generate n number of crops out of the image we pass to the preproccesor.

1.1 The preprocessor will generate the crops, save them in a folder only visible to each client (teacher) network.
1.2 For communicating right now, i can output the seeds to a text file that can be read by the server later on.

2. setting up the client learner (fine-tuner)

2.1 this will use the dataset from a folder again, which is just visible to the client itself.
2.2 do the fine-tuning task using some pre-trained model (exact model yet to be decided and the amount of layer I am gonna retrain, have some idea like resnet).
2.3 for selecting the dataset for fine-tuning, we can use cifar-10,100 and imagenet (with 1000 classes).
2.4 we also need to select the image set, which we are gonna divide using some distribution equally among all the networks. (distribution strategy can be worked upon)
2.5 output the predictions of the selected dataset on a local file, which can be accessed by the student network.

3. setting up the server learner (Student)
3.1 use something with ViT
